There is a lack of constitutional literacy among citizens due to the complex language and limited accessibility of the Constitution of India. This project aims to develop "Nagrik Aur Samvidhan" — an innovative, interactive digital platform that simplifies key constitutional elements, including the Preamble, Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles, and Fundamental Duties, into an accessible and engaging format. The solution will feature a comprehensive backend database, multilingual support, and multimedia integration to promote inclusivity. Through interactive simulations and scenario-based activities, the platform will enhance understanding of constitutional concepts, enabling citizens—especially youth—to make informed decisions about their rights and duties.
